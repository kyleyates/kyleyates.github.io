I am a mathematics Ph.D. student in the [School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences](https://www.clemson.edu/science/academics/departments/mathstat/index.html) at Clemson University in Clemson, South Carolina. Currently, I am studying cryptography under the direction of my advisor Dr. Shuhong Gao.

I received my M.S. in mathematical sciences from Clemson University in 2022 under the direction of Dr. Shuhong Gao. I earned my B.S. in applied mathematics from San Diego State University in 2020 under the direction of Dr. J. Carmelo Interlando.
