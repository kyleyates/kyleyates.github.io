I am a mathematics Ph.D. candidate in the [School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences](https://www.clemson.edu/science/academics/departments/mathstat/index.html) at Clemson University in Clemson, South Carolina. Currently, I am studying cryptography under the direction of my advisor Dr. Shuhong Gao. My department profile for Clemson can be found [here](https://www.clemson.edu/science/academics/departments/mathstat/about/profiles/kjyates).

Originally from the town of Roseburg, Oregon (timber capital of the nation!), I became interested in mathematics during my undergraduate at San Diego State University. I earned my B.S. in applied mathematics at San Diego State in 2020 under the direction of Dr. J. Carmelo Interlando. From there I moved to Clemson, South Carolina for graduate school. I received my M.S. in mathematical sciences from Clemson in 2022 under the direction of Dr. Shuhong Gao, and am now working on my Ph.D. in mathematical sciences.
