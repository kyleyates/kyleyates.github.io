Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. student in mathematics at Clemson University in Clemson, SC. Currently, I am studying cryptography under my advisor Dr. Shuhong Gao.

I received my M.S. in mathematical sciences from Clemson University in 2022 under the direction of Dr. Shuhong Gao. I earned my B.S. in applied mathematics from San Diego State University in 2016 under the direction of Dr. J. Carmelo Interlando.
