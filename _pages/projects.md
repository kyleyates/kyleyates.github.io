### Coding Theory

**Ball-collision Decoding Analysis: Linear Codes in the McEliece Cryptosystem. (Undergraduate Thesis)**

This undergraduate thesis implemented, tested, and analyzed the ball-collision decoding algorithm from Bernstein, Lange, and Peters. The final version of my undergraduate thesis can be found here. My implementation of the ball-collision decoding algorithm in Magma computer algebra can be found here.
